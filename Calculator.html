<div calculator>

int store1Num  = 0;
<!-- Store1 will store in the first digit that is selected-->
int store2Num = 0;
<!-- Store2Num will store in the subsequent digit that is selected, however, should the operator be selected again, we should ideally be able to move store2 to storem1Num 
    and move the new number  into store2Num-->
int operator;
<!-- we should set the operator to use as a switch case. I like the idea of having the operating equal multiple int variables (1 = +) (2 = -) (3 = *) (4 = /)-->

<!-- It should work like this:

store1Num -->
